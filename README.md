# INF1006 Assignment: Minesweeper
By Luna, Claire, and Monica

# Introduction
Minesweeper is a logic puzzle game that requires players to discover and set flags for hidden bombs without detonating any of them. 

This project is a simple version of Minesweeper in that players need to find 10 bombs in a 9*9 grid of cells.

# Requirement
This game requires all 3 files downloaded from this repository. 

The name of the three files are: 1) index.css 2) index.html 3) index.js

# How to Run & Game Rules
* Steps to Start the game:
1) Open index.html
2) Start to click on squares to show numbers/set flags
3) Game result will show above the Restart button
4) Click "Restart" to start over a new game

* Game Rules:
1) When a cell is clicked, it will reveal a number ranging from 0 - 8, indicating the number of bombs that are adjacent to this cell, or a bomb. This number represents the total number of bombs in eight adjacent cells.
2) 0 means there are no bombs in the nearly eight adjacent cells which are similar functions as space in other Minesweeper games. Numbers are used as clues to help players avoid the detonating of bombs.
3) If players suspect this cell contains a bomb, they can mark this cell by a flag ðŸš©

* How to Win/Lose: \
    Win: \
    When all empty cells are revealed and all bombs are flagged. \
